# pwAdminV2

I recreated the old project for pwAdmin, this time with modern frameworks like:
  - nestJS (Typescript, ExpressJS, MySQL promise)
  - ReactJS + TypeScript + MobX
  
  It will contain old features and soon maybe new once, however, this also enough time killing and this also free project, so every donation is welcome.
